## Best Practices

1. **Use clear, concise question text**
2. **Provide meaningful explanations** to help students learn
3. **Set appropriate point values** based on question difficulty
4. **Test your JSON file** with a small sample before importing large sets
5. **Use consistent formatting** for better readability
6. **Include diverse question types** for comprehensive assessment

## File Size Limits

- Maximum file size: 16MB
- Recommended: Keep individual JSON files under 1MB for better performance
- For large question sets, consider splitting into multiple files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid JSON format"** - Check for syntax errors, missing commas, or brackets
