## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/v1/test-series/:testSeriesId/sections` - Create section
- `POST /api/v1/test-series/:testSeriesId/sections/:sectionId/quizzes/:quizId` - Assign quiz to section
- `GET /api/v1/test-series/:testSeriesId` - Get test series with sections
- `POST /api/v1/quizzes` - Create quiz (now supports section field)
- `PUT /api/v1/quizzes/:quizId` - Update quiz (now supports section field)

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- `client/src/components/admin/QuizForm.jsx` - Added section selection and creation
- `client/src/components/admin/QuizManagement.jsx` - Added section display

### Backend:
- `backend/src/models/quiz.model.js` - Added section field
- `backend/src/controllers/quiz.controller.js` - Enhanced to handle sections

## Notes

- Section assignment is handled both in the quiz model (for easy querying) and in the test series sections array (for organization)
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility - existing quizzes without sections will continue to work
- Section creation requires a test series to be selected first
- Quiz can be saved without a section (will be assigned directly to test series)
